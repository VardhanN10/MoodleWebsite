## 🚀 Quick Start (Without Images)

The quiz works perfectly without images! Questions with `image: null` will simply not display an image section. You can:

1. **Start using the quiz immediately** - All questions work without images
2. **Add images gradually** - Add one image at a time as you create/find them
3. **Test with placeholders** - Use simple colored rectangles as placeholders
4. **Focus on content** - Questions are comprehensive and educational on their own
